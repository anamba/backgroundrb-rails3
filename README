= BackgrounDRb

BackgrounDRb is a Ruby job server and scheduler. Its main intent is to be
used with Ruby on Rails applications for offloading long-running tasks.
Since a Rails application blocks while serving a request it is best to
move long-running tasks off into a background process that is divorced
from http request/response cycle.

This new release of BackgrounDRb is also modular and can be used without Rails so that any Ruby program or framework can use it.
